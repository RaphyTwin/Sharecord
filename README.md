## ✨ What is Sharecord?

**Sharecord** is the fastest way to share long code snippets on Discord — no Nitro needed.  
Simply paste your code, let Sharecord generate a text file for you, and drag it into Discord. That's it. No more formatting issues or message limits.

## 💡 Motivation

As developers, we often hit Discord's character limits when sharing code.  
The workaround? Save the snippet as a `.txt` file — but creating and saving those files manually gets tedious fast.

**Sharecord** simplifies the process:
- Copy your code
- Paste it into Sharecord
- Get a ready-to-share text file in seconds  
Perfect for long scripts, logs, or multi-line messages.
