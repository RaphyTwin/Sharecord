## Motivation

Most coders are very annoyed about the limit of a normal discord message. So there are two solutions. Either you buy Nitro or you write your code in a text file to avoid the limit. That's where Sharecord comes in: Normally you have to create a text file with TextEdit or any other program but that takes much time. With Sharecord you can easily copy the code and paste it get a text file created. Then you can easily share unlimited lines of code in just a few seconds.

## Mission

It is our commitment to keep Sharecord open source and free forever, supported by the community.

We strive to remain true to Apple's human interface guidelines and development patterns, ensuring Sharecord looks and feels like an application developed by Apple themselves, which includes a meticulous attention to detail.
