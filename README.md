## Motivation

Most coders are very annoyed about the limit of a normal discord message. So there are two solutions. Either you buy Nitro or you write your code in a text file to avoid the limit. That's where Sharecord comes in: Normally you have to create a text file with TextEdit or any other program but that takes much time. With Sharecord you can easily copy the code and paste it get a text file created. Then you can easily share unlimited lines of code in just a few seconds.

## Installation

Downlaod the [DMG File]() and drag it into the Applications folder.
